To avoid keeping credentials in plain text we can store them in separate, encrypted  confg file.
Then proper permissions for that file should be set.

In addition cofg file can be kept outside the root directory of our project.

Passwords can be hashed but for better security salts should be used.

To additionaly secure hashes "peppers" can be used which make hashes even more difficult to crack.
